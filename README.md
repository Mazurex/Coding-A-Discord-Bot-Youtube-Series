This is all the source code for my YouTube Series ["Coding a Discord Bot"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKh8bSPtQRkMT0zNKxiUIqnCXjCgDIZ-z)

If any of the source codes have a file named ".env.example", rename it to ".env" in your own code.

It's easy to copy and paste this code! Simply download the code, and in your preferred console, type "npm i" to install all the required libraries (they are prespecified in package.json so you don't have to specify which libraries to download).
Afterwards, in the same console (or wherever you are hosting this bot) run "node bot/index.js" (this path may change depending on where you execute the command)

If you come across any bugs, errors or issues, join my Discord server and directly ask for help: https://discord.gg/AYmdn5UuwJ

# Each episode and what it does:

Episode 1: Setup  
Episode 2: Basic Command & Event handler and using dotenv  
Episode 3: Slash command handling  
Episode 4: Ban and unban commands  


# Extra:  

All this code is MADE BY **Mazurex** ("notmazurex" on discord (Owner of Beans Cavern, server link above) , "mazurex4" on twitter / X), if anyone else claims to have coded this, they are lying.  
The only exception is: The Event and Command handlers were made by **maybeizen** ("maybeizen" on GitHub, "maybeizen" on Discord, "maybeizen" on twitter / X)

I don't have a licence for this, so you can copy and paste my code, however if you will use my code, please leave some credit, this allows me to grow.
